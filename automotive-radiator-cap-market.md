<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Radiator Cap Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vented Cap</li><li>Non-Vented Cap</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive radiator cap market comprises two primary types: vented caps and non-vented caps. Vented caps allow excess pressure to escape, preventing the coolant from boiling over and ensuring optimal engine temperature. They incorporate a pressure relief mechanism to manage coolant flow and protect the system. In contrast, non-vented caps maintain a sealed environment, helping to retain pressure but lacking the ability to vent, which can lead to overheating if the pressure builds excessively. Both types play a crucial role in vehicle cooling systems.</p></p>
